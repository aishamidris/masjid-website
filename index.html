    <h2>About Our Masjid</h2>
    <p>
      Located in Bosso Lowcost, Minna, Masjidu Darul Arqam is more than just a place of worship, it is a community center where faith, learning, and brotherhood come together.

      Our masjid is a home for both elders and youth, where the teachings of Islam are upheld in every activity. We are committed to nurturing spiritual growth, encouraging good conduct, and ensuring discipline within our community.

      Beyond worship, the masjid plays a vital role in supporting the less privileged, offering guidance, and strengthening unity among the people of Bosso Lowcost. Together, we strive to build a society that reflects the values of Islam, mercy, justice, and responsibility.
